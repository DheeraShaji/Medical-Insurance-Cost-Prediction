# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Abstract
Health insurance or medical insurance is a type of insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses. Machine learning and deep learning for the insurance industry sector can make the policies more efficient. This project shows how different regression models can forecast insurance costs. Results of Elactic Net Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Deep neural network are compared and concluded that Deep NN with Mean absolute error: 39.35, Mean squared error: 325045.17 and Root Mean squared error: 570.12, is the best model.

## Introduction
Health insurance is a type of insurance coverage that pays for medical and surgical expenses incurred by the insured.
Health Insurance companies have a tough task at determining premiums for their customers. 
Even though some conditions are more prevalent for certain segments of the population, medical costs are difficult to predict since most money comes from rare conditions of the patients. The objective of this article is to accurately predict insurance costs based on peopleâ€™s data, including age, Body Mass Index, smoking or not, etc.
