# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning


## Abstract
Health insurance or medical insurance is a type of insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses. Machine learning and deep learning for the insurance industry sector can make the policies more efficient. This project shows how different regression models can forecast insurance costs. Results of Elactic Net Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Deep neural network are compared and concluded that Deep NN with Mean absolute error: 39.35, Mean squared error: 325045.17 and Root Mean squared error: 570.12, is the best model.
